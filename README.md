# Salads & Lip Sweaters 
From pigeons to puckheads, from hockey fans to NHL fanatics, Salads & Lips Sweaters is a hockey themed gaming hub with games to test your hockey IQ or hockey inspired games to pass the time during TV timeouts. 

As an avid hockey fan, Salads & Lip Sweaters was created as a way to challenge my coding ability while showcasing a passion for the game I love and providing a home to add small projects over time in one place. Puckhead, was the inital game as a fun way to test my NHL player knowledge.
